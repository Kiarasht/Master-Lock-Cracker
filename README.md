# Master Lock Cracker

# Status: Finished

Crack any master lock key by feeling resistances and putting them in the calculator. I feel like this deserves a disclaimer that this app should only be used only trying to break into your own lock. I don't endorse or support people breaking into other people's property. But maybe it will also make people realize how terrible these locks are. This algorithm was originally written by Samy Kamkar in JavaScript and here are the instruction to finding the combinations:

# Find the "First Locked Position"

1. Set the dial to 0.

2. Apply full pressure upward on the shackle as if trying to open it.

3. Rotate dial to the left (towards 10) hard until the dial gets locked.

4. Notice how the dial is locked into a small groove. If you're directly between two digits such as 3 and 4, release the shackle and turn the dial left further until you're into the next locked groove. However, if the dial is between two half digits (e.g., 2.5 and 3.5), then enter the digit in-between (e.g., 3) into First Locked Position in the calculator below.

# Find the "Second Locked Position"

5. Do all of the above again until you find the second digit below 11 that is between two half digits (e.g., 5.5 and 6.5), and enter the whole number (e.g., 7) into Second Locked Position in the calculator below.

# Find the "Resistant Location"

6. Apply half as much pressure to the shackle so that you can turn the dial.
7. Rotate dial to the right until you feel resistance. Rotate the dial to the right several more times to ensure you're feeling resistance at the same exact location.
8. Enter this number into Resistant Location. If the resistance begins at a half number, such as 14.5, enter 14.5.

# Input the Numbers into the Calculator

9. Make sure all three numbers are entered into the calculator at the top of this page, then click Find Combos.
